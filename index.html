          <h5 class="card-title">What is Property and Casualty Insurance</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Property and casualty insurance is a vital component in the
            financial well-being of individuals, businesses, and communities. It
            provides protection against a wide range of risks, ensuring
            financial stability and peace of mind.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This type of insurance is designed to safeguard policyholders
              against unexpected events and ensure that they can recover from
              financial setbacks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Property and casualty insurance is essential because it allows
              individuals and businesses to protect their assets, minimize
              financial losses, and maintain their standard of living or
              operations following an unexpected event.
            </li>
            <li>
              It also helps to create a more stable and resilient society by
              spreading the financial risk associated with accidents, natural
              disasters, and other unforeseen events.

          <p class="card-text">
            PPM is the tool where we are creating defects. For e.g. JIRA,
            ServiceNow, HP ALM, Azure DevOps. PPM is a system or methodology
            used by organizations to manage and oversee projects and their
            portfoloios. In this context, it specifically refers to a tool where
            "defects" are created.

          <h5 class="card-title">What is CSR(Client Service Request)</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            A Client Service Request (CSR) is a formal request made by a
            customer to a service provider for assistance, support, or a
            specific action related to a product or service. It is commonly used
            in industries such as IT, telecom, banking, and customer support to
            track and manage customer inquiries efficiently. Key Aspects of a
            CSR - Request Submission – Customers submit a CSR through various
            channels like email, phone, or online portals. - Tracking &
            Resolution – The request is logged, assigned to a relevant team, and
            tracked until resolution. - Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) – Many
            CSRs operate under SLAs, ensuring timely responses and resolutions.
          </p>

          <p class="card-text">
            CSR is a formal request from a client or for a service, change or
            resolution of an issue. In this context, it seems to be a broader
            term that encompasses various types of requests that might lead to
            development work or support activities.
          </p>

          <h3>Policy Type</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>BOP: </strong>A Business Owner’s Policy combines several
              essential coverages into one package, typically for small to
              medium-sized businesses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automobile: </strong>- Covers vehicles used for business
              purposes. This can include cars, trucks, or vans that are owned,
              leased, or rented by the business. It typically protects against
              liability, collision, and comprehensive damages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Workers Compensation: </strong>- Mandatory in many
              regions, this policy provides medical benefits and wage
              replacement to employees who are injured on the job. In return,
              employees generally waive the right to sue their employer for
              negligence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>General Liability: </strong>- Covers a wide range of
              common business risks—like bodily injury, property damage, and
              even advertising injury (such as copyright infringement or
              slander). This is the cornerstone of most business insurance
              plans.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Inland Marine: </strong>- Despite the name, this policy
              has nothing to do with ships. It covers goods, tools, and
              equipment in transit or stored offsite. It’s especially useful for
              businesses that frequently transport valuable items.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Property: </strong>Protects the physical assets of your
              business, like buildings, inventory, equipment, and sometimes even
              outdoor signage. It typically covers losses from fire, theft, and
              some natural disasters.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Defect:</h3>
          <p>
            A defect is a flaw, error or fault in a computer program or system
            that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to
            behave in unintended ways.
          </p>

          <h4>Creating Defects:</h4>
          <p>
            This means logging or recording a newly discovered issue or bug
            within the PPM tool, often including details like steps to
            reproduce, expected vs. actual behabiour and severity.
