          <p class="card-text">
            A Client Service Request (CSR) is a formal request made by a
            customer to a service provider for assistance, support, or a
            specific action related to a product or service. It is commonly used
            in industries such as IT, telecom, banking, and customer support to
            track and manage customer inquiries efficiently. Key Aspects of a
            CSR - Request Submission – Customers submit a CSR through various
            channels like email, phone, or online portals. - Tracking &
            Resolution – The request is logged, assigned to a relevant team, and
            tracked until resolution. - Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) – Many
            CSRs operate under SLAs, ensuring timely responses and resolutions.
